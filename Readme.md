# 4th Coding Project:  Code Institute Full Stack Project

This is my 4th coding project. In this project I created a YOGA website applying the CRUD principles. The website offers users a platform to browse suitable yoga classes and make immediate purchase of the classes that interest them.
We are currently offering 6 different yoga programs and 3 class passes. Users can either purchase class passes or individual classes based on their needs.
A search tool is created for users to filter by class title, schedule and instructor. The classes are conducted by 3 instructors who are the owners of the yoga studio. Users can read more about their profiles and choose the classes based on their own preference.
The classes are conducted in small groups and the instructors pace the classes based on each individual's core strengths and weaknesses.
This is a responsive website and the design is simple and easy to use. At the same time, the tools that I have created will respond to the user’s actions and displays information based on users’ requests.


## Project Strategy and Scope
The key intention of this project is to create a website to showcase our instructors and yoga classes whereby users can easily access the website for class details and schedule and register for a class instantly. 
The website is designed in a way that users have to register and login before they can purchase classes. Based on the CRUD principles, our instructors/owners of the studio who can login as superusers to create, read, update and delete records on the website.
Students and other users are not allowed to edit in the website except for changing their user profile details i.e. first name, last name, email address, password. In this project, i use django to store the class data and user records.
As part of the design process, I have saved the wireframes in folder: /static/imagewireframes. To view the jpg images, please change size view to 20%.

###(i)Overview

Based on above project strategy, I identified the following requirements:
1) The website must provide users with ease of navigation and displays information that is clear and easy to read.

2) Content Requirements

The website includes a simple landing page that displays the introducton of the yoga studio, yoga studio main features and yoga reviews. Users can either scroll down the landing page for all the reviews.

The website pages included:

## Navigation Bar (Public view)

1)Home
This is the landing page which contains 3 sections. 
First Section: An introduction of the yoga studio , core features of our yoga studio and student reviews.

2)Classes
This features a dropdown list for users to buy classes, list of class passes, search of classes.
Purpose is for easy access where users can filter and browse for classes that are offered by the yoga studio.

3)Instructors
This page contains instructors profile where users can read about our instructors background and experiences.

4)Register
This is a link to new users registration where users creates an account by completing the form with personal details:
(first name, last name, email address). Using the form to create a new username and password to access our website to purchase yoga classes.

5)Login
This is a link user login menu where user enters their username and password. There is a link below the login placeholders where users can click on for password resets if required.

5)Admin
This is for purpose of admin use where superusers can access this link to create new class/class passes and perform edits/deletes of classes/class passses.

## Navigation Bar (Login as a registered user excludes superuser login)

Ther navigation bar is similar to public view except that the register link will be hidden and the naviagation will show the 'car't link and the 'login' link will change to show the login username and a dropdown list for users to edit their profile, view account details, change password and logout.

To test if the function works, please use:

Eg. User Account 
Username: admin1234
First Name:mary
Last Name:lee
Email Address:howyjane@gmail.com
Password:howy0144

6) Cart
This is where users can click to view their order summary of classes that they purchased.
In the cart, users can select the number of quantity that they wish to purchase for each class enrolled and if they wish to remove the classes, they may do so by clicking the 'Remove class' button.
Once users decides to puchase the classes, they may click on 'checkout' button. At checkout, users will make payment on Stride checkout page using credit card or google pay .
At the moment, this is a test account and has yet to be implemented. 

To test if stride payment is working, please use :
Card: 4242 4242 4242
Exp date: 12/23
CCV: 123

## Navigation Bar (Login as a superuser only)

### (iii) Limitations

the information in html. 

Challenges for reset password function.i managed to perform a few password resets to my hotmail account and it was working. But a few days before project submission, my sendgrid account has been deactivated. 
Please use the backend email in settings.py if you wish to test the password reset login.

There isn't an account folder in my project. I saved the account registration templates (logged_out.html, login.html, password resets htmls) in the core Django Project 4 Lifestyle path under templates/registration.

The change_password.html is saved in home/templates/home/change_password.html.

## Project Surface

1. To test the functionality and usability of the site, I did a class presentation. 

Their feedback was the website was calming and the fonts on the button and links color need to change to a darker color. I change the fonts to black.

2. Testing the navigation links to ensure the pages are linked.

## Search function

Tests were carried out for each search tool ensuring that the search results display the correct results.


## Add/Update function

Created several dummy records to add/update via website and django admin. Ensuring that the records are created and updated correctly.

## Authentication function

Created several users and superusers accounts for login to my website and the navigation menu changes and hides the correct menu items correctly.
Superusers are able to view the admin create, edit/delete function.
Registered users are unable to view the admin dropdown list and after login, the cart menu appears.

## Password Reset function
Challenges for reset password function.i managed to perform a few password resets to my hotmail account and it was working. But a few days before project submission, my sendgrid account has been deactivated. 
Please use the backend email in settings.py if you wish to test the password reset login.

## Password Change function
Changed a few users password and it works.

## Bugs Discovered
CSRF token not working during user login. Need to clear cach and browing history to get it working again.
